### Explanation of Code and Algorithm used is placed with the code as comments.

## Problem 1:

We are using Binary Search Tree for this problem.

Time complexity : O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Problem 2:

We are using Binary Search Tree for this problem.

Time complexity : O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Problem 3:

Using Max Heap as algorithm

The overall time complexity is O(nlogn)
Space complexity for is O(n)

## Problem 4:

We are using several pointers to traverse the array only once. 

The time complexity is O(n) due to single traversel
The space complexity is O(1) as in place replacement of pointers is happening.

## Problem 5:

Insert operation in the tree has time and space complexity dependent on the inputs provided.

The time complexity for Trie is O(n)
The space complexity is also O(n)


## Problem 6:

Due to the single traversal across all the elements.
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Problem 7:

We are using Trie as algorithm here, For the trie, time complexity of searching and inserting from a trie depends on the length of the path n thatâ€™s being searched for.
Hence, The runtime complexity of insert and find is O(n), Hence overall time efficiency is O(n).

The worst case space complexity of a Trie is O(n), this happens when all the paths are unique
